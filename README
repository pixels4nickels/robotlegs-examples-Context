Simple example of using Robotlegs 2 Context and Mediator functionality.

This example will create 2 views.

View One has a few buttons that will be mediated through mapping an interface that is implemented on BasicButton. 
The ButtonClickMediator will act as a controller by dispatching a custom event when it hears a mouse click on
either button.

View Two is also mediated through mapping an interface to DisplayableMessageMediator.
Any view implementing this interface will get it's message set on it from the DisplayableMessageMediator.

This example merely shows how you can dispatch custom events and listen for them in different views.
