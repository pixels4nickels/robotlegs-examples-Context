Simple example of using Robotlegs 2 Context and Mediator functionality.

This example will create 2 views.

View One has a few buttons that will be mediated through mapping an interface that is implemented on BasicButton. 
The ButtonMediator will act as a controller by disptaching a custom event when it hears a mouse click on either button.

View Two is also mediated through mapping an interface to MessageMediator. 
Any view implementing this interface will get it's message set on it from the MessageMediator.

This example merely shows how you can dispatch custom events and liasten for them in different views.
